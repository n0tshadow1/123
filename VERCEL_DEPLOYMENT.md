# YTdown - Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
1. Push all your code to GitHub (including the new Vercel config files)
2. Make sure all files are committed:
   - `vercel.json` (Vercel configuration pointing to app_vercel.py)
   - `vercel_requirements.txt` (Python dependencies - simplified for serverless)
   - `.vercelignore` (Files to exclude from deployment)
   - `app_vercel.py` (Simplified Flask app for serverless)
   - `video_downloader_vercel.py` (Simplified downloader for serverless)

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login with GitHub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect it as a Python project
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Environment Variables (Required)
In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Any random string (e.g., "your-secret-key-here")

### 4. Your Live URL
After deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
